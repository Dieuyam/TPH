# THP - Projet Final - The Perfect House (THP)

A big Thanks to our Wonderful Dream Team, our mentor Alex Perisic and the The_Hacking_Project Community.
After 2 weeks of webdevelopment we finally build the MVP of TPH.
The Challenge was hard but we succeed to create the prototype.
The second version will be implemented soon ;-) ...
